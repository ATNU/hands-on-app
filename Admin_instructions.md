# Hands-On Reading Admin Instructions

TODO: Check this is the correct URL once deployed

To view the submitted pages and feedback forms, go to this URL: [https://hands-on-reading.ncldata.dev/admin](https://hands-on-reading.ncldata.dev/home). You do not need to be logged in. 
Admin pages are best viewed on a PC rather than tablet.

## Summary data
This page lists all users along with the numbers of saved pages and forms. If you scroll to the bottom of the page there is a downloads section where you can download a CSV of summary data and all feedback forms. 
Each time you click this the CSV will be given a unique name.

You can click on a row in the table to view a particular user's activity. 

## User results
This screen lists all feedback forms and saved pages for a single user. each user has a unique code listed at the top of the page.

In each table you can click on a row to see the full result.

## Saved page
This page displays a single saved manuscript page with user submitted drawings. If you scroll to the bottom of this page there is an option to display a png image file of the text and user drawings. This can be opened in image viewing software such as Paint (Windows) or preview (Mac). At present this file does not include the manuscript background (this is a feature for the future). If you need to save the text and user submitted drawing with a background, use a screenshot tool such as Snipping tool (Windows) or Grab (Mac).
