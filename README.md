## Development Server
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
The server and client must be run in conjunction with either a locally installed version of mongoDB or mongoDB running in Docker.


## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
